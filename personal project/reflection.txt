Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.

There were many of those moments, but the one who standed out the most to me was when we were writing functions on the Canva. (scene.py)
I saw the power of functions and how they play a huge role in bigger programs.


2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?

You can write what the function is supposed to do and make sure they all are working just fine before finishing your program.
You can catch up errors of production and they also indicate where the function needs to be fixed.

3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?

I normally have the habit of executing the code and trying the options one by one.
There are other methods of doing this, writting test functions and debugging, but that's my way to test things.
I can use Debugging more often to improve my testing process. Recently I have used it and it helped me to see things in a much better way.
